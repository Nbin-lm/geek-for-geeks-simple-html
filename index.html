        <h3 style="font-style: bold;">Introduction</h3>
        The Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Information Technology (B.Sc. CSIT)
        curriculum is designed by closely following the courses practiced in accredited international
        universities, subject to the condition that the intake students are twelve years of schooling in
        the science stream or equivalent from any university recognized by Tribhuvan University
        (TU). In addition to the foundation and core Computer Science and Information Technology
        courses, the program offers several elective courses to fulfill the demand of high technology
        applications development. The foundation and core courses are designed to meet the
        undergraduate academic program requirement, and the service courses are designed to meet
        the need of fast changing computer technology and application. Students enrolled in the four
        year B.Sc. CSIT program are required to take courses in design and implementation of
        computer software systems, foundation in the theoretical model of computer science, and a
        functional background of computer hardware. All undergraduate students are required to
        complete 126 credit hours of computer science course and allied courses.</p>
        <h3 style="font-style: bold;">Objective</h3>
        <p>The main objective of B.Sc. CSIT program is to provide students intensive knowledge and
            skill on different areas of computer science and information technology including design,
            theory, programming and application of computer system. It is envisaged that graduate of this
            program will be equipped with necessary knowledge of computer software and hardware
            system.
            Eligibility Condition for Admission:
